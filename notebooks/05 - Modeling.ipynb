Volume 1 at least had a fast pace, its innovations coming quick and fast; but Volume 2 of this over-long project seems to add nothing new except for a layer of emotional interpretation that its grotesque, cartoonish characters can scarcely sustain. Volume 1 pastiched a huge range of different styles of film; Volume 2, at times, appears simply as a pastiche of a bad movie (and very hard to distinguish from a genuinely bad film to boot). Yet I can't help but feel that within these two movies (originally conceived as one very long film) there's a highly original shorter film that should have been made. When the saga ends with a credits sequence in which Tarantino appears to pay homage to himself, one can't help but wonder whether even the most talented of individuals don't sometimes benefit when someone else has the final cut.\"\n",

This is not true. Yes, for a human to fly in space, they would have to survive being burned up leaving Earth's atmosphere, then survive the vacuum of space (in other words, two people would have been dead by the end of the movie). However, let's revisit the 1978 original, in which the Man of Steel flies around the world, making it spin backwards, which also makes time reverse. If that really happened, every living thing and object on the planet's face would be flung off into the cold depths of space.I won't linger on this anymore. Yes, The Quest for Peace has unbearable dialogue (in places), but it's classic Superman-- the cheese, the cheap effects, and the general cartoon feel. Plus, it does have Jon Cryer, in what is oddly his best performance of all time (you'd better believe it), and a solid message people still need to think about. In other words, come to believe a man can fly, stay for the inherent message of the movie: we would have to be very stupid to nuke our own planet.\"\n",

    "review = \"This is the fourth and final Superman film with Christopher Reeve taking on the role, where he tries to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and battles Lex Luther (Gene Hackman) and his super-powered sidekick, Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow).Though the level of excitement and intrigue of this film doesn't match the first two, it is almost on par with the third and is still fun and fast-paced with neat special effects that showcase Superman's powers and great action scenes, something that sorely lacks in Superman Returns.The nuclear weapons plot I thought was clever and unique to a Superman movie. Total disarmament of nuclear weapons may not be feasible in the real world, but Superman's quest for peace among all countries is well-intended in the film. Reeve is great as Superman and Gene Hackman gave us another thrilling performance as super villain Lex Luther. In addition, the fight scenes between Nuclear Man and Superman were awesome - Nuclear Man looked like a force to be reckon with as he possessed the same level of powers and same physique as Superman.Overall, I think this film is a fitting ending to the Christopher Reeve saga.\"\n",
