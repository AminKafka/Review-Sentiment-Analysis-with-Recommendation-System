# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis and Hybrid Recommandation Engine


This project tries to combine the sentiment analysis and recommendation system in one package.
The final goal of this project is to create a recommendation system based on the user review
sentiment, and create a list of similar movies that users might like to watch and would be
interested in writing a review for. First, the model needs to know if the review is positive or
negative. Then, if the review was positive, it can pick a similar movie using the movies genre,
the director, and actors to create a recommended list for the user.
